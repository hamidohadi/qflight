abstract = "Tunable spin correlations are found to arise between two neighboring trapped exciton-polariton condensates which spin polarize spontaneously. We observe a crossover from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic pair state by reducing the coupling barrier in real time using control of the imprinted pattern of pump light. Fast optical switching of both condensates is then achieved by resonantly but weakly triggering only a single condensate. These effects can be explained as the competition between spin bifurcations and spin-preserving Josephson coupling between the two condensates, and open the way to polariton Bose-Hubbard ladders."
