Dr Hamid Ohadi is a newly appointed lecturer in physics at the University of St
Andrews. His research interests fall into the broad scheme of photonics and
quantum information, specifically, emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium
light-matter many-body systems. He leads the Quantum Fluids of Light Lab, which
looks at the fundamental properties of *exciton-polariton condensates* and
exploiting them for making *ultrafast photonic devices*.
