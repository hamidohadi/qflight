## What is the project?

{{< figure src="/~qflight/img/devices.png" class="image-flow-right">}}
Our aim is to build ultra-highspeed (50 GHz) room-temperature opto-electronic
chips based on our recent demonstration of spontaneously magnetised polariton
condensates [1,2]. Exciton-polaritons (polaritons) are superpositions of photons
in a Fabry-Pérot microcavity and confined excitons in 2-dimensional quantum
wells. They are very light (100,000 times lighter than electrons) and very fast
(>100 GHz) thanks to their photonic component, but they can also strongly
interact with each other due to their excitonic part. Polaritons can form
macroscopic quantum states like atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and using
organic materials they can condense at room temperature.  In certain conditions,
polariton condensates can spontaneously acquire macroscopic spins of up or down.
In this project we aim to exploit them to make ultra-highspeed optoelectronic
switches and true random number generators on a chip that can be integrated into
the next generation of CPUs and telecommunications.   

## What is my involvement?

You will fabricate electrically contacted organic-based microcavities in close
collaboration with Prof. Turnbull and Prof. Samuel’s group, and study the
condensation and specifically their spin properties. You are also expected to
travel to the sunny island of Crete in Greece for some parts of the fabrication
process.

## Are there any industrial links?

Yes, we have an ongoing industrial partner at [Hitachi, Cambridge](http://www.hit.phy.cam.ac.uk/).

## Is this PhD project funded?

Yes, this is a fully funded CM-CDT studentship, which covers your tuition fees
and subsistence.

## How can I apply?

Send your CV and cover letter to [Dr Ohadi](mailto:ho35@st-andrews.ac.uk).
