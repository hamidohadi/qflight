## What is the project?

{{< figure src="/~qflight/img/spin-lattice.png" width="300rem" class="image-flow-right">}}
One of the most interesting concepts in condensed matter is the so-called
“frustration”, where a few spins in the system cannot find an orientation to
fully satisfy all the interactions with its neighbouring spins. Frustration is a
complex and not well-understood phenomenon with interdisciplinary applications
to artificial neural networks as well as material science. The classic example
is 3 spins a triangular geometry with antiferromagnetic coupling between the
nearest neighbours. We have recently introduced exciton-polariton (polariton)
condensates as a new platform to study such spin interactions [1-3]. Polariton
condensates are macroscopic quantum states with picosecond dynamics and unique
spin properties arising from their nonlinearities.  

## What is my involvement?

You will experimentally study the spin properties of coupled polariton
condensates in 2-dimensional optical lattices in various geometries,
specifically the phenomenon of frustration. Your project will also involve a
fair amount of programming, and numerical simulations in a collaboration with
our theorists.

## Are there any industrial links?

Yes, we have an ongoing industrial partner at [Hitachi, Cambridge](http://www.hit.phy.cam.ac.uk/).

## Is this PhD project funded?

Yes, this is a fully funded CM-CDT studentship, which covers your tuition fees
and subsistence.

## How can I apply?

Send your CV and cover letter to [Dr Ohadi](mailto:ho35@st-andrews.ac.uk).
